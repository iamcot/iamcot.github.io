<h2>Greetings, fellow humans! </h2>
<p>I am {CoT}, and I've decided to grace the internet with my own little corner of the web – a Vietnamese blog.</p>

<p>Prepare yourselves for a delightful (and hopefully not too chaotic) journey through the realms of technology, programming, AI (because let's face it, the future is now!), travel adventures, and the occasional triathlon rant (you know, for those days when the swim feels like an Olympic event).</p>

<p>Why in Vietnamese, {CoT}?</p>

<p>"The internet is already drowning in English content!". You see, while tech docs abound, many are lost in translation (literally!). So, I aim to bridge this gap and bring a touch of clarity to the tech-curious minds out there. Especially for those brave souls just starting their tech journey – I know the struggle is real!</p>
<p>Consider this blog your friendly guide, your digital mentor, your tech-savvy confidante. (Okay, maybe not that close, but you get the idea.)</p>

  Thank you for joining me on this wild ride. Let the tech-tastic adventures begin!
